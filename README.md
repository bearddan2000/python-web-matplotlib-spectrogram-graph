# python-web-matplotlib-spectrogram-graph

## Description
A demo of creating a spectrogram graph.

A spectrogram can be defined as the visual representation of frequencies against time which shows the signal strength at a particular time. In simple words, a spectrogram is nothing but a picture of sound. It is also called voiceprint or voice grams. A spectrogram is shown using many colors which indicates the signal strengths. If the color is bright then it means that the energy of the signal is high. In other words, brightness of the color is directly proportional to the strength of the signal in spectrogram.
